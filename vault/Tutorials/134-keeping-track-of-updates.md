# 13.4. Keeping Track of Updates

## Content

### Goal

Keep your site safe and up-to-date by keeping up with the latest security updates.

### Prerequisite knowledge

[Section 13.3, “Concept: Security and Regular Updates”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/security-concept "13.3. Concept: Security and Regular Updates")

### Steps

Sprout Video

There are a few different ways to receive notifications of security releases:

- Highly critical security announcements will be displayed on the administration pages of your website. A link will be shown to the announcement on Drupal.org which explains when and how you can update your website.
- In the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *Reports* > *Available updates* > *Settings*. Enter the email addresses to be notified when updates are available. You can also specify whether you want daily or weekly updates. Click *Save configuration*.
- Subscribe to the security announcements email list. To subscribe, log in to *Drupal.org*, go to your user profile page and subscribe to the security newsletter on the *Edit* > *My newsletters* tab.
- Follow @drupalsecurity on X.
- Subscribe to RSS feeds for [core security updates](https://www.drupal.org/security/rss.xml), [contributed project updates](https://www.drupal.org/security/contrib/rss.xml) and [public service announcements](https://www.drupal.org/security/psa/rss.xml).
