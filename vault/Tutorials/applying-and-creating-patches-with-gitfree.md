## Overview

This tutorial takes a look at applying a patch from Drupal.org to your local copy of a module or Drupal core using Git. Afterwards we'll look at how you can create your own patches, using `git diff` and `git format-patch`, in order to contribute code back to Drupal or any of the module's on Drupal.org. You can see a full Git workflow using GitHub in the lesson [Git Workflow: Putting It All Together](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/git-workflow-putting-it-all-together).
