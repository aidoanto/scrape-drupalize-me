### What is Drupal Licensing?

Drupal and all contributed files hosted on *Drupal.org* are licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or later. That means you are free to download, reuse, modify, and distribute any files that are part of a project on *Drupal.org* under the terms of GPL version 2 or 3. You can also run the core software in combination with any code with any license that is compatible with version 2 or 3.

Drupal contributors should follow these guidelines:

- All files (PHP, JavaScript, images, Flash, etc.) that are part of a project on *Drupal.org* have to be under GPL version 2 or later.
- All Drupal contributors retain copyright on their code, but agree to release it under the same license as Drupal.
- Drupal modules and themes are a derivative work of Drupal. If you distribute them, you must do so under the terms of GPL version 2 or later.
- All content on *Drupal.org* itself is copyrighted by its original contributors, and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license 2.0.
- Sample code on *Drupal.org* is also available under GPL version 2 or later.
