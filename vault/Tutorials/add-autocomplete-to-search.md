# Add Autocomplete to Search

## Content

Autocomplete provides a brief and quick list of results to the user while typing. While this functionality isn’t available out of the box, it’s easy to add using an additional contributed module, Search API Autocomplete.

In this tutorial, we'll:

- Describe how to add autocomplete functionality to an existing index

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to add an autocomplete feature to the search query text field.

## Goal

Add autocomplete to an existing Search API view block.

## Prerequisites

- [Create Search Pages and Blocks with Views](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/create-search-pages-and-blocks-views)
- [Processors in Search](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/processors-search)

## Search API Autocomplete

The [Search API Autocomplete](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_autocomplete) module augments your existing search views by providing a dropdown list of results as users type. This allows users to skip the search page entirely, and instead go right to matched content.

### Download and install Search API Autocomplete

Use Composer to download the Search API Autocomplete module:

```
composer require drupal/search_api_autocomplete
```

Enable the module using Drush:

```
drush en -y search_api_autocomplete
```

### Apply autocomplete to our search view

Once the module is downloaded and installed, we need to apply autocomplete to our Search API-powered view. If you've been following along, you've already created such a view and configured the exposed filters to display as a block in the header of each page.

1. Login to your Drupal site with administrator privileges.
2. Using the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *Configuration* > *Search and metadata* > *Search API* (*admin/config/search/search-api*).
3. Open the target index for editing.
4. Open the *Autocomplete* tab.
5. Notice a table of Search API-powered views appears in the list. Using the checkbox(es), select the views to which to add autocomplete.
6. When finished, click *Save*.

### Validate the configuration

Once applied, no further work is needed to use autocomplete. We do not need to reindex, as autocomplete does not modify the Search API index.

1. Navigate to your search page provided by your Search API-provided view.
2. In the search field, begin entering a search term. Remember, if you are using autogenerated content from Devel, use special care in selecting a search term that matches the placeholder text.
3. After a couple of characters, suggestions appear in a dropdown from the search box:

### Customizing autocomplete

Search API Autocomplete allows for the autocompletion configuration to be customized per view. You can select the number of results to display, which view display modes to use, and even select which fields in the Search API index to use for autocompletion results. Furthermore, Seach API Autocomplete uses a pluggable architecture to add further customizations.

1. Login to your Drupal site with administrator privileges.
2. Using the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *Configuration* > *Search and metadata* > *Search API* (*admin/config/search/search-api*).
3. Open the target index for editing.
4. Open the *Autocomplete* tab.
5. Locate the target search view, and click *Edit*.
6. Select the *Suggester plugins* to use. By default, *Display live results* is not selected. Enable this option if you want to see results as you type.
7. Select the view *Displays* to on which to apply Autocomplete. Selecting none will enable autocomplete on all view displays.
8. Configure the *Maximum number of suggestions*.
9. Configure the remaining options as you see fit. When finished, click *Save*.

### Export the configuration

Using Drush, export your site configuration (`drush cex`). Then, add and commit the results to your repository.

## Recap

Search API Autocomplete enables quick and easy autocompletion for Search API-powered views. Once installed, you need to enable autocompletion per view. After typing a few characters in the search box, a dropdown appears of search results. This allows site visitors to jump directly to matched content without needing to visit a search result page. You may choose to customize autocomplete results by editing the Search API index.

## Further your understanding
