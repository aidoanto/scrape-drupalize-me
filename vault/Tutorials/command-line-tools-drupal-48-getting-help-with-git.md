# Getting Help with Git

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

This tutorial takes a look at the various resources that are available for getting help with Git including the built-in manual/help pages and examples as well as other documentation that we've found to be useful while learning how to use Git.

## Learning objectives

- Be able to use the built in git help command to find more information about specific commands
- Students should be familiar with documentation available online on the official Git site and on help.github.com
- Students should be familiar with the Git documentation available on Drupal.org both in the handbook and on individual project pages.
