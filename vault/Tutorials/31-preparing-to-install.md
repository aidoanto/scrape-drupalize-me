# 3.1. Preparing to Install

## Content

### Goal

Outline the steps to download the core software, and handle any required prerequisites.

### Prerequisite knowledge

- How to install and configure server software (if installing on your own computer)
- How to set up hosting for a generic web site
- How to create a database

### Site prerequisites

Server software must be installed on the computer where you plan to host your site. See [Section 3.2, “Concept: Server Requirements”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/install-requirements "3.2. Concept: Server Requirements") for a list of requirements.

See [Section 3.5, “Setting Up an Environment with DDEV”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/install-ddev "3.5. Setting Up an Environment with DDEV") for the recommended way to get started running the software locally.

Depending on how you plan to download the core software, you may need to install additional software tools first. See [Section 3.4, “Concept: Methods for Downloading and Installing the Core Software”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/install-decide "3.4. Concept: Methods for Downloading and Installing the Core Software") and [Section 3.3, “Concept: Additional Tools”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/install-tools "3.3. Concept: Additional Tools").

### Steps

Sprout Video

1. Choose methods for downloading and installing the core software, from those listed in [Section 3.4, “Concept: Methods for Downloading and Installing the Core Software”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/install-decide "3.4. Concept: Methods for Downloading and Installing the Core Software"). The rest of these instructions apply to the Composer and manual download options; if you chose other options, like a one-click installer from a hosting provider, consult the relevant documentation for any additional steps.
2. Set up a URL and hosting for your site on the server. Verify that the hosting is working by putting a simple HTML file in the web root directory of the hosting, and visiting the URL for your site.
3. Create a database, along with a database user account with full access.
4. Download the core software files to the web root directory, using the method you decided on. See [Section 3.4, “Concept: Methods for Downloading and Installing the Core Software”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/install-decide "3.4. Concept: Methods for Downloading and Installing the Core Software") for links to instructions.

### Expand your understanding

See [Section 3.7, “Running the Interactive Installer”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/install-run "3.7. Running the Interactive Installer") to run the interactive installer.
