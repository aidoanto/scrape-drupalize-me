# 5.2. Creating a Content Item

## Content

### Goal

Create and publish a content item that will be used as the home page of the site.

### Prerequisite knowledge

- [Section 5.1, “Concept: Paths, Aliases, and URLs”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/content-paths "5.1. Concept: Paths, Aliases, and URLs")
- [Section 2.3, “Concept: Content Entities and Fields”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/planning-data-types "2.3. Concept: Content Entities and Fields")

### Site prerequisites

3. Fill in the fields as shown below.

   | Field name | Explanation | Value |

   | Summary | Summary of the value of the body field. Can be used as teaser in overview pages | Opening times and location of City Market. |
   | Body | Full content of the page | Welcome to City Market - your neighborhood farmers market!  Open: Sundays, 9 AM to 2 PM, April to September  Location: Parking lot of Trust Bank, 1st & Union, downtown |
   | Published | Whether the content is published for public view or not | Checked |
