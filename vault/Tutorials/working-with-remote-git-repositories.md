# Working with Remote Git Repositories

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

This tutorial is all about making two git repositories talk to one another. So far everything we've done has been on your desktop. But we're going to need a way to share changes with other people on our team, or deploy them to our production site. To do that we're going to learn about the git clone, push, pull and fetch commands.

Git is a Distributed Version Control system which means that the copy of the repository that you've got on your desktop is a complete clone of the repository. Make changes, commit and ... then you need to figure out how to share those changes with other people who also have a complete copy of the repository.
