# i.3. Organizationfree

## Content

This user guide contains a series of topics, each of which covers either a *task* (how to do something) or a *concept* (background knowledge, terminology, and the like). Concept topics have names starting with *Concept:*, while task topics have names containing verbs, like *Editing Basic Site Information*.

The topics are grouped into chapters in a logical order, with concepts and tasks interleaved so that concepts are presented before related tasks, and tasks build on each other. To take advantage of this, you are encouraged to read the entire guide in its presented order, possibly skipping topics that are not of interest or that present information you already know. Remember to try out the tasks on your own site as you read the guide; most people learn better by doing rather than reading.

If you prefer, you can also use the index or table of contents to jump straight to a topic that you’d like to learn about, rather than reading the entire guide. To facilitate this approach, each topic lists the prerequisite knowledge that you’d need in order to understand it, if any (with links to the topics that present that knowledge); task topics also list *site prerequisites* (things that you would need to have configured or created on your site in order to perform the task). Also, most topics have sections at the end where you can find related information and/or tasks for expanded understanding, to continue your learning.

You may also want to refer to the [Glossary](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/glossary "Glossary") section as you read — it gives brief definitions of most of the terminology used in the guide, with links to topics having more detailed explanations.
