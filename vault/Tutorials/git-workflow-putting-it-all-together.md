# Git Workflow: Putting It All Together

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

In this tutorial, Joe walks you through a typical Git workflow. We start with cloning a repository, creating a branch, and getting some work done. Then we go ahead and commit our work, merge it into the master branch, and push our changes back up to the remote repository. If you'd like to listen to a discussion of various Git workflows, and using Git with teams, you can also check out the [Drupalize.me Podcast 15: Git Craziness](https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupalizeme-podcast-15-git-craziness).
