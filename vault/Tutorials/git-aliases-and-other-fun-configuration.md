# Git Aliases and Other Fun Configuration

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

We've now learned about all sorts of commands in git and the flags that accompany those commands. We've also seen that some of those commands can get to be a bit long and are used quite often. In this tutorial, we're going to take a look at how to create command aliases in our *.gitconfig* file so that we can have a shorthand for accessing some of these more esoteric commands. We'll also take a quick tour of Joe's personal *.gitconfig* file that he uses in his day-to-day work.
