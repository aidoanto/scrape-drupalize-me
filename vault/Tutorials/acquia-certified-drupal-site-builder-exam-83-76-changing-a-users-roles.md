# 7.6. Changing a User’s Roles

## Content

### Goal

Change or add roles to a given user, either by editing a single-user or by applying a bulk operation.

### Prerequisite knowledge

[Section 7.1, “Concept: Users, Roles, and Permissions”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/user-concept "7.1. Concept: Users, Roles, and Permissions")

### Site prerequisites

The user account that you want to update, and the role you want it to have, must already exist. See [Section 7.4, “Creating a User Account”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/user-new-user "7.4. Creating a User Account"), [Section 7.3, “Creating a Role”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/user-new-role "7.3. Creating a Role"), and [Section 7.5, “Assigning Permissions to a Role”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/user-permissions "7.5. Assigning Permissions to a Role").

### Steps

#### Updating the roles using single-user editing method

1. In the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *People* (*admin/people*).
2. Locate the user 1 account (named "admin") to assign it the *Administrator* role. If it is not immediately visible, use the *Name or email contains* filter, or other filters, to narrow down the list.
3. Click *Edit* to update the user account.

#### Updating the roles using bulk editing method

1. If the users Happy Farm and Sweet Honey did not already have the Vendor role, here is how you would add it. In the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *People* (*admin/people*).
2. Locate Vendor user accounts *Sweet Honey* and *Happy Farm* and check them. If they are not immediately visible, use the *Name or email contains* filter, or other filters, to narrow down the list.
3. Select *Add the Vendor role to the selected user(s)* from the *Action* select list.
