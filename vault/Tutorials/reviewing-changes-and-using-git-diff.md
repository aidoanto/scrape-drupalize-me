# Reviewing Changes and Using Git Diff

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

This lesson covers the `git diff` command and how to use the command along with a Git Treeish reference to view the differences in a project or a single file between two commits. Or between the current HEAD and the working tree. We'll also take a look at integrating Git with some external diff tools that make reading the output from the `git diff` command a bit easier.
