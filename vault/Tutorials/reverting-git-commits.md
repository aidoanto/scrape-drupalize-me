# Reverting Git Commits

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

It happens to the best of us, sometimes we commit something that just simply wasn't ready, or maybe we're having a bad day and introduced a bug to the code. I've even seen scenarios where you've created a temporary workaround in your codebase and now you're ready to remove that workaround and put in a real fix. This lesson looks at using the `git revert` command to deal with these scenarios by creating new commits that reverse the changes of a previous commit.
