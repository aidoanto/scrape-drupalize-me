# Advanced Git Add and .gitignore

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

This tutorial dives deeper into the different things you can do with the `git add` command. Things like adding multiple files at a time using wildcards and staging and adding only some of the changes you've made in a file and not all of them. We'll also take a look at using a *.gitignore* file to exclude specific files or even patterns of files from the repository all together.
