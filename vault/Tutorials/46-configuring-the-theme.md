# 4.6. Configuring the Theme

## Content

### Goal

Edit the settings of the default core Olivero theme to change the color scheme and to add a logo.

### Prerequisite knowledge

[Section 1.3, “Concept: Themes”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/understanding-themes "1.3. Concept: Themes")

### Steps

Sprout Video

1. In the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *Appearance* (*admin/appearance*).
2. Under *Installed themes*, you will find Olivero listed as your default theme. Under *Olivero (default theme)*, click *Settings*.

4. Under *Upload logo image*, locate a logo file and upload it to your site. Note: You can also set a universal logo for all themes under *Appearance* > *Settings* (*admin/appearance/settings*). A custom logo for your theme will override the universal logo.

   Once you have selected the file you would like to upload, you will see its filename next to the *Choose File* or *Browse* button in your browser.
5. Under *Olivero Utilities*, you can choose to use a different color scheme for the theme. You can choose from a list of existing color scheme’s, or enter a color and the core software will generate a new scheme based on that color.

For example, use the following custom color:

+

| Field | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Primary base color | #7db84a (green) |

+ Note: You can also use a color picker by pressing the colored square on the right to select a color of your choice. The web color codes will be added for you.

1. In order to save your changes and see the updated colors and logo on your site, click *Save configuration* at the bottom of the page.
2. Click *Return to site* or *Home* in the toolbar to verify that you have updated the core Olivero theme settings for your website.
