# Using SSH and SCPfree

## Content

Sprout Video

In this video you'll see how simple it is to connect to a remote server using SSH (secure shell). We'll also look at how you can quickly and securely copy files from a remote server using the SCP command (secure copy). These are both invaluable tools when working with servers that you don't have physical access to. Note: this video was originally released April 8, 2010 on [Lullabot.com](http://ww.lullabot.com).
