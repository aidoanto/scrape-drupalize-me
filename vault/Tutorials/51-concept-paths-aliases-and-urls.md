# 5.1. Concept: Paths, Aliases, and URLs

## Content

### What is a URL?

URL is the abbreviation for "Uniform Resource Locator", which is the page’s address on the web. It is the "name" by which a browser identifies a page to display. In the example "Visit us at *example.com*.", *example.com* is the URL for the home page of your website. Users use URLs to locate content on the web.

### What is a Path?

A path is the unique, last part of the URL for a specific function or piece of content. For example, for a page whose full URL is *<http://example.com/node/7>*, the path is *node/7*.

Here are some examples of paths you might find in your site:

- *node/7*
- *taxonomy/term/6*
- *admin/content/comment*
- *user/login*
- *user/3*

### What is an Alias?

The core software has a feature called "URL Alias" that allows you to provide a more understandable name to the content. So, if you have an "About Us" page with the path *node/7*, you can set up an alias so that your visitors will see it as *<http://www.example.com/AboutUs>*. The core Path module, which supports URL aliasing, provides this functionality.
