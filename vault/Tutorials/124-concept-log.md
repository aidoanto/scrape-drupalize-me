# 12.4. Concept: Log

## Content

### What is a Log?

Your site captures system events in a log to be reviewed by an authorized individual at a later time. The log is a list of recorded events containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings, and operational information. It is vital to check the log on a regular basis as it is often the only way to tell what is going on.

You can find your site’s recent log messages in the *Manage* administrative menu by navigating to *Reports* > *Recent log messages* (*admin/reports/dblog*). These logs may be cleared by administrators and automated cron tasks, so they should not be used for [forensic logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_trail). For forensic purposes, use the Syslog module.
