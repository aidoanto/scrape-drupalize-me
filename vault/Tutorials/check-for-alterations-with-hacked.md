# Check for Alterations with Hacked

## Content

It's not uncommon to patch, or customize, contributed modules during the lifetime of a site. It's important to know if you've done so when planning for a migration since you'll want to be sure that you don't lose any customizations when you start using an updated version of a module.

In this tutorial we will walk through using the [Hacked! module](https://www.drupal.org/project/hacked) to check for any alterations to your Drupal code base.

## Goal

Use the Hacked! module to check for modifications to the code of Drupal core, or any contributed modules or themes, that your site uses.

## Prerequisites

- [Prepare for a Drupal-to-Drupal Migration](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/prepare-drupal-drupal-migration)
- [Drupal-to-Drupal Migration Planning: Code Inventory](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/drupal-drupal-migration-planning-code-inventory)

## Hacked!

The Hacked! module provides a really easy way to scan the code that makes up the modules on your site, and to then compare it with the canonical version of each module from Drupal.org. This will allow you to quickly see if any of your modules have been modified, or "hacked". Having hacked modules isn't necessarily a bad thing. It might mean that you had some specific customizations that were needed for your site, or that you've applied a patch that hasn't yet made it into a stable release of the module. Either way, cataloging these changes is important.

## Using Hacked

### Download and install the Hacked module

The [Hacked module](https://www.drupal.org/project/hacked) can be downloaded from Drupal.org and installed just like any other module. For the purpose of preparing for a migration I recommend installing, and running, the Hacked module on a development copy of your site.

Note: Enabling Hacked requires the Drupal core Update module. The Update module provides the utilities required to communicate with Drupal.org in order to get information about module versions.

### Generate a report

With the Hacked module enabled, navigate to Reports > Hacked in the administration menu. If this is the first time you've visited the Hacked module report it might automatically start generating a new report. If it does not, you can trigger a manual report generation. The Hacked module will poll Drupal.org for information about all the modules you've currently got enabled on your site. It will then perform a diff between the code in your copy of the module, and what's available on Drupal.org in an attempt to locate any changes.

The Hacked module is smart enough to compare like versions of modules. So if you've got an older version of the Token module installed on your site, Hacked will compare against the older version on Drupal.org.

### Review the report

The report generated by Hacked sorts modules into three categories:

- **Unchecked**, meaning that Hacked was not able to retrieve the required information from Drupal.org. This usually indicates that this is either a custom module, or that you're using an unreleased version -- for example, a Git checkout of a specific commit. You'll need to do a bit of manual research to figure out what's going on with these modules.
- **Changed!**, indicates that the version of the module you have installed has different code than the same version on Drupal.org, so you'll want to figure out what has been changed.
- **Unchanged!**, indicates that the module you have installed matches what's available on Drupal.org and you don't need to do anything else.

### Review Changed! modules

Any module in the report that has a status of Changed! will require further review. You'll need to figure out what changed, and why. Clicking the module's name in the list will take you to a page that lists all the files contained in the module and indicate which files have been modified.

Example:

<drupal-media data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="59641b8b-ed4c-408a-94e2-7cb56d688622" alt="Close up of report page with "view changes" link highlighted">

If you've got the [Diff module](https://www.drupal.org/project/diff) installed, files with modifications will be a link that you can click. Clicking the file name will show you a diff of the changes.

Example:

## Recap

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Hacked! module to review your site's code base for modifications to any of the files. We created a report, talked about the various statuses that a module could have in the report, and finally looked at how you could review the modifications made to any modules marked as changed.

Unfortunately, we can only help you figure out *what* changed, but not *why* it changed. That's something you'll need to uncover yourself. Once you do, I highly recommend making some documentation about the changes. Add notes to your tracking spreadsheet, or anywhere else convenient. When it comes time to start building your upgraded Drupal site you can then use those notes to figure out what changes you'll want to keep and which you can discard.

## Further your understanding

- Do any of the modules on your site have alterations that need to be accounted for?
- [This article by Chromatic](https://chromatichq.com/blog/how-manage-your-drupal-patches-drush-patch-file) looks at a few different ways you can manage your patches making it easier to track what's been altered in the future.
- If you've got alterations to any of your contributed modules or Drupal core make sure they are added to your tracking spreadsheet
