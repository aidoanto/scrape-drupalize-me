# Git Crash Course

## Content

Sprout Video

In this lesson we're going to quickly jump into the basics of a whole bunch of different git commands and get our repository created, add a couple files, and then view our log.

This tutorial is part of our [Introduction to Git course](https://drupalize.me/course/introduction-git).

## Learning objectives

- Understand the use of `git init` to initialize a new repository.
- Get the current status of your repository using `git status`
- Use `git add` to add something to the stage and `git commit` to commit what is on our stage.
- Understand the concept of a stage and how Git uses the staging area.
- Understand that Git tracks content and not files so if you edit a file you'll need to add it to the stage again.
