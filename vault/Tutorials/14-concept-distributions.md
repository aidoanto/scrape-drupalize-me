### What are Distributions?

*Distributions* provide site features and functions for a specific type of site as a single download containing the core software, contributed modules, themes, and pre-defined configuration. A distribution makes it possible to set up a complex site for a specific purpose, in fewer steps than installing and configuring elements individually.

There are two main types of distributions:

Full-featured Distributions
:   A full-featured distribution is a project that provides a complete solution to set up a site for a specialized purpose, such as academic, business, government, nonprofit, publishing, social, etc. For example, you could use an existing distribution for farmers markets to build your own website, or you could share your set-up for the farmers market site as a distribution for others to use.

Other Distributions
:   Distributions can also be quick-start tools that developers and site builders can use as a starting point.
