# 5.3. Editing a Content Item

## Content

### Goal

Update the hours on the Home page content item.

### Prerequisite knowledge

[Section 5.2, “Creating a Content Item”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/content-create "5.2. Creating a Content Item")

### Site prerequisites

A content item for the Home page must exist. See [Section 5.2, “Creating a Content Item”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/content-create "5.2. Creating a Content Item").

### Steps

Sprout Video

1. In the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *Content* (*admin/content*).
2. If the content item you want to edit was updated or created recently, it should appear near the top of the content list on that page. If not, you can use the *Content type*, *Title*, or other filters to locate the content item.

3. Click *Edit* in the row of the content item you want to edit (Home), to open the content editing form. Update the opening hours in the *Body* field. See [Section 5.2, “Creating a Content Item”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/content-create "5.2. Creating a Content Item") for an explanation of the fields and a screenshot.
4. Check *Create new revision* under *Published*, if it is not already checked, and enter a *Revision log message* explaining what changes you are making (for example, you might enter "Updated opening hours"). This text will appear in the revision log for the page.

5. Click *Save* to save your changes.
6. You will be redirected back to the *Content* administrative page, and there should be a message showing that the content item was updated.

### Expand your understanding

As an alternative to the first two steps above, you can also reach the content edit form as follows:

1. Starting from your site’s home page, use the site’s navigation menus to locate the page where the content you want to edit is displayed to visitors.
2. Most themes will display an *Edit* link or tab near the top of that page to people with permission to edit the page; clicking the link will take you to the full content edit form.
