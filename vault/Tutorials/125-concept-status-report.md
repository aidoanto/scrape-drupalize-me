# 12.5. Concept: Status Report

## Content

### What is a Status Report?

The status report is a short overview of your site’s parameters as well as any problems detected with your installation. It may be useful to copy and paste this information into support requests filed on *Drupal.org’s* support forums and project issue queues or when asking for help on other channels.

You can find the status report in the *Manage* administrative menu by navigating to *Reports* > *Status report* (*admin/reports/status*).
