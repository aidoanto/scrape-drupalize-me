# 5.4. Designating a Front Page for your Site

## Content

### Goal

Configure which content item is displayed as the front page of your website.

### Site prerequisites

The content item that you want to designate as the front page of your site must exist. See [Section 5.2, “Creating a Content Item”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/content-create "5.2. Creating a Content Item").

### Steps

1. In the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *Configuration* > *System* > *Basic site settings* (*admin/config/system/site-information*).
2. Under *Front page*, replace */node* with the name of the page you would like to make the home page. To use the home page that was previously created, provide its path */home*. Click *Save configuration*.

- [Section 5.6, “Adding a Page to the Navigation”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/menu-link-from-content "5.6. Adding a Page to the Navigation")
- Follow [Section 5.2, “Creating a Content Item”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/content-create "5.2. Creating a Content Item") to create an error page to be used as a 404 (page not found) or 403 (not authorized) response on your site. Then following the steps here, you can designate it as the error response, in the *Error pages* section of the configuration.
