# 7.7. Assigning Authors to Content

## Content

### Goal

Assign Vendor content items Happy Farm and Sweet Honey to the corresponding Vendor user accounts, so they can edit their own Vendor profiles on the site.

### Prerequisite knowledge

- [Section 7.1, “Concept: Users, Roles, and Permissions”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/user-concept "7.1. Concept: Users, Roles, and Permissions")

### Site prerequisites

- The Vendor content type must exist, and your site must have at least two Vendor content items. See [Section 6.1, “Adding a Content Type”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/structure-content-type "6.1. Adding a Content Type"), [Section 6.3, “Adding Basic Fields to a Content Type”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/structure-fields "6.3. Adding Basic Fields to a Content Type"), and [Section 5.2, “Creating a Content Item”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/content-create "5.2. Creating a Content Item").
- User accounts for at least two vendors must exist. See [Section 7.4, “Creating a User Account”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/user-new-user "7.4. Creating a User Account").

### Steps

1. In the *Manage* administrative menu, navigate to *Content* (*admin/content*).
2. Find Vendor content item Happy Farm in the list. If it is not immediately visible, you can filter the list by *Published status*, *Content type* (Vendor), *Title*, or *Language*. Click *Edit* for the Vendor content item you would like to assign an author to.
3. Under *Authoring information*, start typing the Vendor’s user name Happy Farm in the *Authored by* field. The field lists matching user names. Select the Vendor’s user name from the list.
