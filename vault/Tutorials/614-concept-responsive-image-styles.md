### What are responsive image styles?

The core Responsive Image module provides responsive image styles. This allows you to have images in your website that are specifically sized for different screen sizes. This is useful, for example, to make your site load faster on mobile devices because image sizes are optimized for smaller screens.

A responsive image style is a mapping between image styles and breakpoints. Breakpoints are the points where a responsive design needs to change in order to respond to different screen sizes. Responsive image styles can either work with breakpoints defined in your theme or with breakpoints defined in the responsive image style settings.

When a responsive image style is defined, it can be used in the display settings for Image fields. This allows the site to display responsive images using the HTML5 *picture* tag, or using the *srcset* and *sizes* attributes in an *img* tag, depending on how the responsive image style is set up.
