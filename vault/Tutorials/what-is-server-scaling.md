# What Is Server Scaling?

## Content

Server scaling is the process of adding more resources (CPU, memory, disk space, etc.) to a server (or servers) to help with performance. This might be a single server, or a cluster of different machines. When we talk about *server scaling*, think more about the *resources* and less about the specific hardware. Modern servers may not always resemble a physical machine that you can open up and insert additional RAM into. But the theory is the same: more memory means the server can handle more concurrent requests.

Sometimes your Drupal site is optimized, but traffic is still high and takes most of the server’s resources. In order to sustain that load you'll need to scale your server up.

Sometimes you don’t have the resources or expertise to implement caching optimizations, refactoring code, and modifying slow queries -- all of which would improve Drupal's performance. In these cases, you may consider server scaling.

Server scaling can be done in two ways: horizontally or vertically.

In this tutorial we'll:

- Learn what server scaling is
- Discuss examples of both horizontal and vertical server scaling
- Talk about when to choose horizontal versus vertical scaling strategies

By the end of this tutorial, you should understand the concept of server scaling and how it applies to a Drupal application.

## Goal

Introduce concepts and terminology related to server scaling.

## Prerequisites

- None

## What is server scaling?

*Server scaling* means adding CPU, memory, and storage resources to the server to help it sustain the load. At the point when your server resources cannot keep up with a load generated by the traffic to your site, you may consider server scaling.

The terminology was originally used to describe physical hardware -- adding another machine to the rack, or more memory to the existing machine. Modern infrastructure often doesn't have the same physical limitations, but the concepts are still the same. Your server doesn't have enough processing power? Add some more. Though now, this might mean adding compute units in a cloud dashboard rather than replacing that old CPU with a new one.

When evaluating your application's hosting and server infrastructure, you should consider its scalability. *Scalability* is the server's capacity to grow and accommodate rapid traffic increases. Many platforms support *autoscaling* where they'll monitor the application's current usage and scale resources (and costs) up or down automatically as needed.

Scalability can be *vertical* or *horizontal*. You can use just one option, or both.

Server scaling and optimizing your application's code combine to create the overall performance profile of a site. For example, if serving a certain request takes a lot of CPU, and you've identified that as a bottleneck, both optimizing the code and adding additional processing power to the server can positively impact overall performance. You can, and should, do both. You might also evaluate when it makes sense to spend the money on more and more complex optimizations vs. more compute power.

## What is vertical server scaling?

Vertical server scaling refers to adding more resources to a single server and increasing its parameters such as CPU, memory, or storage. It’s typically the most straightforward option for server scaling since you already have the server set up and may need to perform a minor hardware upgrade or buy a bigger server from the hosting provider.

Hosting platforms typically offer various server sizes. It’s common to start on a smaller server and grow as the site's audience increases.

The biggest downside of vertical server scaling is its capacity. The resources of a single server cannot scale to infinite values, and you may reach a ceiling at some point. Extreme scaling may also get cost-prohibitive.

## What is horizontal server scaling?

Horizontal scaling refers to increasing the number of servers that support the Drupal application and spreading the load between them. Horizontal scaling comes with increased infrastructure complexity but may be very load-effective.

One common pattern for Drupal applications is to separate the Drupal application server (web server) and the database server. The configuration from the Drupal end is as simple as updating connection information to point to the new database server. It's harder (but not impossible) to do horizontal scaling for the database server itself because you need a canonical source for the data and can't have each instance of the application writing to a different database.

Another common pattern is to use an Apache Solr search index hosted on a separate server. This can both increase the quality of search results and reduce the load on Drupal, since processing a search query can require a lot of resources.

Taking it a step further, you may consider replicating your web application server to one or more servers that are identical to the original one. In this case, each application server will handle a partial load, and no single server will have to take the total traffic load of the site. This setup requires a load balancer to route the traffic between the application servers.

Hosting your horizontal servers in the same data center is essential to ensure reduced load time -- unless you have multiple load balancers connecting to different distributed data centers to increase global performance.

Web operations platforms like Acquia and Pantheon provide SaaS solutions that allow for managed server scaling in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

When scaling servers horizontally, you also need to consider parallel code deployments to all servers. All web servers should be running the exact same Drupal code, or it can cause issues. Depending on your hosting provider and resources, you may consider writing a continuous integration script to pull the code from your centralized Git repository to the servers.

## Horizontal vs. vertical scaling

Horizontal scaling is easier from a hardware perspective. It might be easier to set up new servers than update the old ones. Implementation of horizontal scaling doesn't require extensive downtime since adding new servers doesn't impact operations of old ones. It's a more expensive option out of the gate because new server hardware is more expensive than hardware upgrades. Also, the result system tends to be more complicated than the vertically scaled system.

Vertical scaling tends to be more cost-effective and also results in a less complicated system setup. However, vertically scaled systems have less resilience since the entire system has a single point of failure and therefore more possibilities for downtime. There's a finite limit to how high you can go. However, your application may be well within that range, making vertical scaling a perfectly acceptable approach.

## Recap

To improve site performance you eventually need to add more resources like memory, CPU, and storage. When this happens you'll need to scale your server.

There are 2 main approaches to server scaling. Horizontal scaling means splitting your application load between multiple servers. Vertical scaling means adding more resources to a single server.

Vertical scaling is the simplest way to scale your server, but it’s limited in terms of the final server capacity. Horizontal scaling can be more effective, but increases the complexity of the server infrastructure.

## Further your understanding

- Think about scenarios where you might choose vertical scaling over horizontal.
- Draw a diagram of a horizontally scaled server infrastructure for a Drupal site.
- Server scaling is highly dependent on your hosting provider. Talk to them about your options when the time comes, and read up on how others using the same provider have scaled their Drupal infrastructure.
