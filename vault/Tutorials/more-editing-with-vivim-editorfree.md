# More Editing with Vi/vim Editorfree

## Content

Sprout Video

This video picks up where we left off in the [Editing with Vi/Vim video](https://drupalize.me/videos/editing-vivim-editor?p=1149). This time we take a look at some shortcuts for replacing text, how to copy/paste, and the cool visual mode feature you get with Vim Note: this video was originally released August 31, 2010 on [Lullabot.com](http://ww.lullabot.com).

**Note:** In some places the command line prompt is cut-off. The YouTube version of this video doesn't have the cut-off problem. We are working on getting this fixed, but in the meantime, check out the YouTube version instead.
