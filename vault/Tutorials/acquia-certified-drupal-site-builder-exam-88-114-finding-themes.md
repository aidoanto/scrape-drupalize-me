# 11.4. Finding Themes

## Content

### Goal

Find and evaluate themes on *Drupal.org*.

### Prerequisite knowledge

- [Section 1.1, “Concept: Drupal as a Content Management System”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/understanding-drupal "1.1. Concept: Drupal as a Content Management System")
- [Section 1.3, “Concept: Themes”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/understanding-themes "1.3. Concept: Themes")

### Steps

Sprout Video

1. Go to <https://www.drupal.org>, and navigate to *Download & Extend > Themes* (<https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme>).
2. Filter your search using the categories on the theme search page. For example, you might use these filters:

   | Field name | Explanation | Example value |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Maintenance status | How actively is the theme maintained? If a theme is actively maintained, you can expect bug fixes and improvements on a regular basis. | Actively maintained |
   | Development status | What kind of development is the theme undergoing? If you select *Under active development*, you can expect new features to be added, and some aspects may still change. If you select *Maintenance fixes only*, it means that the theme is considered complete. | Any |
   | Core compatibility | The Drupal version the theme is compatible with. | 9.x |
   | Status | *Sandbox projects* are experimental projects. *Full projects* have already gone through an approval process, but they can still be in development. | Full projects |
   | Stability | Whether or not the project maintainer has created a production-ready version. | Has a supported stable release |
   | Security advisory coverage | Whether or not the project maintainer has agreed to follow Drupal Security Team procedures. | Has security advisory coverage |
   | Search themes | Search by search term in the theme’s description. | - |
   | Sort by | Order your search results by criteria like *Most installed* (popular themes that many sites use) or *Last release* (date of latest version released). | Most installed |

4. To further evaluate a theme, click its title in the list of search results to visit its project page.

Some aspects to pay attention to while evaluating themes:

- Introduction: The description of the theme on its project page should be clear and useful. A screenshot of the theme helps your evaluation as well.
- Project information: There may be warnings in this area of the page, such as if a theme is no longer being developed, or is not covered by the security advisory policy.
- Project information > Reported installs, downloads: You can see how many people have downloaded and how many sites use the theme.
- Issues: See if there are any open issues, potential problems with the theme. Check the Statistics to see how regularly issues are responded to.
- Documentation, Resources: Check if the theme has documentation or a README file, that can help you install, configure, explore, and test it.
