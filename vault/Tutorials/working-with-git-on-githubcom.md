## Overview

GitHub is a great, free service that lets you share your Git repositories online with others. In this lesson Blake gives a quick tour of our [Git Series Example GitHub project](https://github.com/Lullabot/git-series-example), and then explains how pull requests work, letting you merge changes into the repository through the UI. (Note: the repository has been archived and is read-only.)
