# Copy, Move, Delete on Command Linefree

## Content

Sprout Video

The second video in the command line basics series, this one covers common commands for dealing with files; copying, moving and deleting them. We walk through examples for the following commands: cp, mv, and rm.

Just a a fair warning that I say the word "stuff" way too many times in this video. Please just bear with it.
