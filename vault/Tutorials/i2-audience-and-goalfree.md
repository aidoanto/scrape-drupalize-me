# i.2. Audience and Goalfree

## Content

This guide was written mainly for people with minimal knowledge of the Drupal content management system. The topics will help them become skilled at installing, administering, site building, and/or maintaining the content of a Drupal-based website. The guide is also aimed at people who already have some experience with a current or past version of Drupal, and want to expand the range of their skills and knowledge or update them to the current version.

This guide assumes that you have already decided you want to learn and use Drupal. If you need to learn more before deciding, see [Section 1.1, “Concept: Drupal as a Content Management System”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/understanding-drupal "1.1. Concept: Drupal as a Content Management System").

Depending on which aspects of Drupal you would like to learn, you will need some background knowledge to understand this guide: general Internet skills and knowledge are assumed, and the guide concentrates on how to use the software itself. For instance, the sections about installing Drupal on a web server assume you can obtain web hosting and figure out how to transfer files to your chosen web host. Similarly, the sections about content management assume you can log into a website and fill in a web-based form.

After reading this guide, you should be able to:

- Plan the content architecture for a Drupal-based site
- Build the site that you planned
- Manage and administer your site
- Understand documentation and blog posts on topics not covered here, to expand your knowledge and skills
- Connect with the worldwide Drupal community
