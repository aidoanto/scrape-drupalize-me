# Editing with Vi/vim Editorfree

## Content

Sprout Video

In this second Vi/Vim video we move on to doing some basic editing (see the [Intro to Vi/Vim video](https://drupalize.me/videos/introduction-vivim-editor) for an overview). We cover inserting text in a few different ways, how to delete text, and then how to revert or save your changes. Note: this video was originally released August 9, 2010 on [Lullabot.com](http://ww.lullabot.com).

**Note:** In some places the command line prompt is cut-off. The YouTube version of this video doesn't have the cut-off problem. We are working on getting this fixed, but in the meantime, check out the YouTube version instead.
