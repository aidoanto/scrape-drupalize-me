# Working with Git Branches and Tags

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll take a look at creating branches with the `git branch` command, and tags with the `git tag` command and explain the differences. Then we'll look at how and when they can be used and how to move changes from one branch to another using the `git merge` and `git rebase` commands and talk about the different ways in which those two commands effect the history of a project.

Note that Blake is using a shortcut for his `git commit` command, and is instead just using `git ci`. He is also using a nice, short way to add a commit message all at the same time, by adding the `-m` flag, for message, to his commit command. You can learn more about git aliases in the following video: <https://drupalize.me/tutorial/git-aliases-and-other-fun-configuration>

Blake is also using a command line modifier which displays the branch he is currently working in. There are many ways you can do this too. Blake recommends the following resource: [https://www.lullabot.com/articles/git-best-practices-history-viewing-ti…](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/git-best-practices-history-viewing-tips-and-displaying-branch-context)
