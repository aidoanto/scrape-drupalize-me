# 2.1. Concept: Regions in a Theme

## Content

### Prerequisite knowledge

[Section 1.3, “Concept: Themes”](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/understanding-themes "1.3. Concept: Themes")

### What is a region?

Besides its primary content, a web page contains other content such as site branding (site name, slogan, and logo), navigation aids (menus, links, and icons), formatted text, and images. Each theme provides a set of named regions, such as *Header*, *Content*, and *Sidebar*, where site builders may choose to place their content.

The available regions depend on the theme design. Only the Content region, which contains the primary content, is required; others are optional. The core Olivero theme provides the regions highlighted in the following image.
