# Quicker Git Commits and Modifying Previous Commits

## Content

Sprout Video

## Overview

In this tutorial, we revisit the `git commit` command and take a look at some of the additional things you can do with it, like amending a previous commit, and creating commits using shorthand methods. Then we'll look at using the interactive rebase command which will allow us to reword commit message and do other things like squash two commits into a single commit when performing a rebase.
