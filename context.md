It's essential to me, my family, my career that I learn to use Drupal 11. There aren't good learning resources for it online, only for earlier versions. My work has paid for me to subscribe to "Drupalize.me", the only source for Drupal 11 tutorials online, but they are pulling the budget for it, and I won't be able to afford to continue. I need to archive all the information I've paid for for future use. I need to scrape all the information, images and videos in markdown format, in a directory structure which can be turned into an Obsidian vault, which I can use for personal use only. I want to eventually be certified so I need to scrape as much of the site as is feasible. The site is behind a paywall, but I've logged in in the browser.
